# WebServer
* This project is to develop a simple Web server in Python that is capable of processing only one request.      
1. create a connection socket when contacted by a client (browser);  
2. receive the HTTP request from this connection;   
3. parse the request to determine the specific file being requested;   
4. get the requested file from the server’s file system;   
5. create an HTTP response message consisting of the requested file preceded by header lines; and   
6. send the response over the TCP connection to the requesting browser. If a browser requests a file that is not present in your server, your server should return a “404 Not Found” error message.
